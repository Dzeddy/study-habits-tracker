## Risk Management Plan

### Technical Risks
- **Data Privacy Concerns**: Implement robust security measures and clear privacy policies
- **Scalability Issues**: Design with scalability in mind, use load testing
- **Third-party Service Dependencies**: Have fallback options for critical services

### Project Management Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Regular backlog refinement, strict change management process
- **Timeline Delays**: Buffer time in schedule, prioritize features
- **Team Communication**: Regular stand-ups, clear documentation, collaboration tools

### Mitigation Strategies
- Weekly risk assessment meetings
- Continuous integration and testing
- Regular user feedback collection
- Documentation of all decisions and technical implementations
